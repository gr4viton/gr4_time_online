# gr4_time_online

This script grabs the right online time from the internet and sets it up as the system time on the windows machine.

I used code from the stack-overflow discussions threads and others:
# https://code.google.com/p/just-the-time/
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/645312/what-is-the-quickest-way-to-http-get-in-python
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12081310/python-module-to-change-system-date-and-time
# https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html

I needed this script as the date and time on my laptop screws up on my win7 installations from time to time, so i don't have to grab it from the internet "manually" from windows clock settings. I hate mouse clicking! Hope it helps you as it helped me.
